# FPGA_Projects
This repository contains the majority of my FPGA side projects and academic coursework

With regards to the CPU pipeline, I based it off of the MIPS instruction set architecture and used this book to help me better understand
the architecture:

Computer Organization and Design Fifth Edition : David A. Patterson , John L. Hennessy

I have also added my C program that parses Verilog files to produce dimacs formatted CNF files.
I was very proud of the work I did to design this C program. It helped me understand how good the C programming language can be!
