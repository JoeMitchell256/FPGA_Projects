This folder holds the files for instruction level verification for my (what is now, but will be 5 stage) 4 stage pipeline.

The idea is to generate random assembly program consisting of only R-Type instructions for the moment

Then send this program though the mips simulator spim
After running the mips assembly program spim it will spit out registers.txt
'registers.txt' is considered the Golden file similar to SystemC

Next I will translate the randomly generated assembly program into machine code
I will then read this program into instruction memory for my pipeline
Then my pipeline will run each instruction 1 by 1 and will send its final register values to another file pipeline.txt
'pipeline.txt' will have the register values of my pipeline

There may need to be conversions from binary to decimal for the 'pipeline.txt' file but thats a problem for another day
